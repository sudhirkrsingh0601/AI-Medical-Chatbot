INFO:__main__:Processed response from llama11b API : The encoders in this picture are the processes that convert information into a format that can be read by the decoder. The encoder is responsible for compressing and processing the input data, making it easier for the decoder to understand and extract the necessary information. In this case, the encoder is likely to perform tasks such as feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and data normalization, which prepare the data for the decoder to use in its decision-making process. Without a properly functioning encoder, the decoder will not be able to extract meaningful information from the input data and make accurate decisions.
INFO:__main__:Processed response from llama90b API : The diagram depicts two encoders: Encoder NX and Encoder. Encoder NX is a more complex model that consists of an input embedding layer, multiple multi-head attention layers, and feed-forward layers. In contrast, Encoder is a simpler model that consists of an input embedding layer, a single multi-head attention layer, and a feed-forward layer.

**Encoder NX:**

*   **Input Embedding:** This layer takes the input data and converts it into a higher-dimensional space, allowing the model to better capture the relationships between different input elements.
*   **Multi-Head Attention:** This layer applies self-attention to the input data, allowing the model to weigh the importance of different input elements relative to each other.
*   **Feed-Forward:** This layer applies a feed-forward neural network to the output of the multi-head attention layer, allowing the model to transform the input data into a more abstract representation.

*   **Feed-Forward:** This layer applies a feed-forward neural network to the output of the multi-head attention layer, allowing the model to transform the input data into a more abstract representation.

Overall, both encoders are designed to capture complex patterns in input data and transform it into a more abstract representation that can be used for downstream tasks such as classification or generation. However, Encoder NX is a more complex model that is better suited for tasks that require a deeper understanding of the input data.
